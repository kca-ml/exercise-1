    "the 2d coordinates are turned to homogenous coordinates by adding a third variable z = 1\n",
    "multiplying these coordinates with the matrix and dividing each row with the last row yields the equations relating the corrected coordinates, the 9 coefficients, and the original coordinates\n",

    "one set of corrected coordinates can be the same as one of the original coordinates\n",
